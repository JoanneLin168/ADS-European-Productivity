## Abstract of the submitted report

"In this report, macroeconomic and macro-social indicators are discussed in detail, with trends in data and relationships between different variables being considered. We particularly focused on labour productivity and economic sentiment levels within the European Union (EU), although other indicators and regions were also included in the analysis performed, in order to enrich it. Additionally, we looked at a variety of statistical and machine-learning methods to study their accuracy and suitability as predictive models for these macro-level variables.

Productivity showed mostly linear growth, particularly when analysed from a regional perspective. Periods of uncertainty in the markets, such as the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic, were revealed to have an impact on both the labour productivity and economic sentiment indexes, although with much greater repercussions on the latter."
